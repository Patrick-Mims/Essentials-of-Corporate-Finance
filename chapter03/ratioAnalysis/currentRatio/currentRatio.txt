Current Ratio - One of the best-known and most widely used ratios is the curent ratio.
As you might guess, the current ratio is defined as:

Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities

Because current assets and liablilities are, in principle, converted to cash over the
following 12 months, the current ratio is a measure of short-term liquidity.
